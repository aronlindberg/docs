> Hack for innovation to solve global challenges.

The IronHacks framework will solve your problem of where to start with documentation,
by providing a basic explanation of how to do it easily.

## Background

IronHacks brings together a virtual hacking community who participate in high-energy IronHacks challenges. The IronHacks platform offers participants a no setup workspace and many powerful features. Participants get access to a Juypter Lab, BIG datasets, dashboards, tutorials so that they can excel in data exploration, prediction and visualization.

## Features

During an iterative multiphase process, the competing participants have access to tutorials, standardized libraries and packages, and virtual help sessions. After each phase, submissions are evaluated within a few hours or days with the help of machine intelligence and human experts. Real-time and targeted feedback accelerate learning and facilitate participants in hacking complex problems.

- Challenges - Easy access to past, current, and future challenges
- Workspace - A workspace that integrates to Jupyter Lab and Big Query that allows you to hack in the cloud with no set-up time and costs
- Feedback - A dashboard with real-time ratings about your submissions as well as access to your peer's solutions.

## Impact

Since 2015, more than 1000 participants have hacked in parallel virtually around the globe gaining valuable experience in coding as well as work for the chance to win internships, Amazon gift cards, cool swag, and certificates. In addition to the participation and learning, IronHacks provides the opportunity to do research on open innovation contest processes.

__Innovation__

Participants developed novel and useful open data solutions in an interactive environment. The platform's features helped them continuously improve their submissions while learning from real-time feedback and others participating in the hack.

__Globalization__

The virtual setting of hacking has emerged at Purdue and beyond. Participants come from the US, Colombia, and China. Virtual setting encourages a more diverse audience.

__Research__

The scientific team at Purdue generated new knowledge and technologies on the implications of machine-enabled feedback and transparency on participants' productivity and innovation performance
